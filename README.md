There are some steps that you can follow if you want to use this chat application
1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LINDAINES213/Chat_XMPP.git
   ```
2. If you don't have Java in your device, you only need to install the `jdk` of your choice, using a `.zip` or an `.exe` file
3. If you have already this project folder in your device, open it with your favorite IDE and search for the `Demoproyecto1Application.java` in the following path: `src/main/java/com/proyecto1redes/demoproyecto1`. When you open it, you run it an you'll have running the application in the `http://localhost:2422/` URL. You can change the port in the following file: `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

If you did everything okay you'll have running the application, and if you want you can improve and add more functionalities in the files that I mentioned before.
